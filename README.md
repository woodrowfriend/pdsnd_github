### Python Script Exploring US Bikeshare Data


### Description
**This Python script is designed to explore US bikeshare data sets from New York City, Washington, and Chicago. The script will walk users through the following quesions and provide data output from the bikeshare dataset based on the filter criteria selected:**

* Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York City, or Washington?
* Would you like to filter the data by month, day, both, or not at all? Type "all" for no time filter.
* Which month? January, February, March, April, May, or June?
* Which day? (e.g., "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")

**The script will then perform the following functions:**

* Load data for the specified city and filters by month and day if applicable.

* Display statistics on the most frequent times of travel.
    * The most common month in this dataset is:
    * The most common weekday in this dataset is:
    * The most common hour in this dataset is:
    * Display query computation time in seconds.

* Display statistics on the most popular stations and trip.
    * The most common starting station is:
    * The most common ending station is:
    * The most common start and end station combination is:
    * Display query computation time in seconds.

* Display statistics on the total and average trip duration.
    * The total travel time in your query is:
    * The average travel time in your query is:
    * Display query computation time in seconds.

* Display statistics on bikeshare users.
    * The counts of usertypes in this query are:
    * The counts of each gender in this query are:
    * The earliest birth year in this query is: 
    * The most recent birth year in this query is:
    * The most common birth year in this query is:
    * Display query computation time in seconds.

* Displays 5 rows of raw data at a time if opted for by user
    * Would you like to review the first 5 rows of raw data? Select yes or no:
    * Would you like to see an additional 5 rows of raw data? Select yes or no:
    * Would you like to restart? Enter yes or no.

### Files used
This project utilized Udacity datafiles Chicago.csv, Washington.csv, and New_York_City.csv.
These datafiles contain abridged bikeshare data for exploration using the Bikeshare.py program
